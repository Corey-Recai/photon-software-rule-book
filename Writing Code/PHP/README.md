# Writing PHP for Photon Software

For the most part, at Photon Software we follow the same PHP coding standards that [The Wordpress Coding Standards](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards). Please make sure that you read through and understand these coding standards.

Every Photon Software backend developer shall always write Object Oriented PHP. There is no reason for any developer at Photon Software to ever write code meant for production in a procedural approach.

Every backend developer is expected to ensure all data is properly validated before saving or outputting any values to and from the database.
