# Wordpress

As a Wordpress Developer for Photon Software, this is your vow.

I vow to...  
* Read, Understand and ALWAYS follow [The Wordpress Coding Standards](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards).  
* ALWAYS use the [Developers Resources](https://developer.wordpress.org/) over the [Wordpress Codex](https://codex.wordpress.org/).  
* ALWAYS use Wordpress as an Application Framwork (head-less theme) and use React for the frontend, unless othwerwize specified in the project.  
* ALWAYS update versions accordingly (`major.minor[.build[.revision]]`) when making changes to exisiting plugins and/or themes.   
* Never make code customizations in the database, including the Wordpress Customizer *Custom CSS* editor.
* ALWAYS research and leverage Wordpress' built-in hooks, filters and loop.
