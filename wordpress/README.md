# Wordpress

As a Wordpress Developer for Photon Software, this is your vow.

I vow to...  
* Read, Understand and ALWAYS follow [Wordpress Coding Standards](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards)  
* ALWAYS use the [Developers Resources](https://developer.wordpress.org/) over the [Wordpress Codex](https://codex.wordpress.org/)  
* ALWAYS use a child theme vs a parent theme, unless othwerwize specified in the project, when customizing any WP site  
* ALWAYS update versions accordingly (`major.minor[.build[.revision]]`) when making changes to exisiting plugins and/or themes   
* Never make code customizations in the database, including the Wordpress Customizer *Custom CSS* editor.
* ALWAYS leverage Wordpress' built-in hooks, filters and loop.

### Wordpress Hosting

The client will always have the freedom to choose their own hosting company. The hosting company along with necessary credentials will be provided with each project.

If the client chooses our hosting services we for their Wordpress site we host it in our account at [Pantheon.io](https://pantheon.io/). Pantheon offers Wordpress specific hosting on an elastic server structure. It also has a built-in workflow that makes it easy to work within a team, test and deploy. With pantheon developers can simply clone the repo and begin working!
