# Wordpress

* Read, Understand and ALWAYS follow [Wordpress Standards](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards)  
* ALWAYS use the [Developers Resources](https://developer.wordpress.org/) over the [Wordpress Codex](https://codex.wordpress.org/)  
* When customizing any theme ALWAYS use a child theme vs making changes directly in the parent theme  
* When making changes to exisiting plugins and/or themes ALWAYS update versions accordingly - `major.minor[.build[.revision]]`  
* Never make code customizations in the database, including the Wordpress Customizer *Custom CSS* editor.
