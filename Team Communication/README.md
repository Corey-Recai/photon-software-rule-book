# Communicating with your team at Photon Software

* All communication within the team will happen via Slack.  
* All internal communication must happen via Direct Message (DM) or the *general* channel.  
* No new channels will be created by any team member for any purpose.  

Some clients will have their own channel assigned in Slack where the project manager, a developer, and the client are all part of. These clients have a retainer agreement with us and their channels are created once we have a signed agreement.

Developers are not expected to communicate directly with the client unless the project manager needs assistance explaining someting technical. 99% of the time it will be the project manager who communicates with the client and the developer, separately, to ensure the project moves along according to the timeline.
