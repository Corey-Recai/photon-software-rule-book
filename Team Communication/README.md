# Communicating with your team at Photon Software

All communication within the team will happen via slack.

Developers will not communicate directly with the client unless the project manager needs assistance explaining someting technical. 99% of the time it will be the project manager who communicates with the client and the developer, separately, to ensure the project moves along according to timeline.

Some of our clients have their own channel assigned to them in slack where the project manager, the developer, and the client are all part of. Even in these cases, we do not expect the developer to be answering questions from the client. That would fall on the Project Manager's responsibility. The developer is there to offer suppoert if needed.

Once enrollment is complete and you receive a Photon.Software email address, you will be invited to slack.
