# Photon Software Rule Book

Every one who writes code for Photon Software must always, without exception, follow a simple set of rules:

* **Comment all code -** Make it easier for future developers (including yourself) to jump right in and understand the logic  
* **DRY -** Don't Reapeat Yourself. Always read through your code to spot inefficiencies  
* **Readability over efficiency -** Don't Reapeat Yourself. Always read through your code to spot inefficiencies  
* **Every project has a repo -** Every line of code written must be under version control  
* **Every dev has a branch -** Developers must always work under their own branch within a repo  
* **Every task has a commit -** It is important to commit every change we complete

Following these simple set of rules ensures collaborative team work without conflicts and allows us to produce scalable and maintainable code.

### Technology Specific Rules

In addition to the set of rules listed above there are some technology specific rules that every developer at Photon Software must also follow. These rules would only apply if the technology is being utilized in the project.

* [Wordpress](wordpress)  
* [Javascript](javascript)  
* [Clients](clients)

### Workflow

There are just a few rules that every developer must always follow:

* Always work on a local (dev) environment  
* Always test your code  
* Always run applicable error checks - flow, linter, etc

### Tracking Your Time

Sometimes knowing what is billable can be a little hazy. Here are some notes that can answer common questions around tracking hours and what is billable work. 

**How do we track hours?**  
We track hours using [Premise Time Tracker](https://premisetimetracker.com). The app has a chrome extension that makes it extremely easy to track your time per task. The simple interface allows you to track your time with two simple clicks - One starts the timer and a second click stops it. Then you can (and should) assign a client, project and a small description of the task performed and you are done.

**Is a phone call billable**  
Absolutely. As a developer, every phone call you are on with the client is billable.  

**What about other forms of communication?**  
Yes. All project related communication is billable. However long it takes you to write an email to explain functionality, or discuss a project will be billable. If a client has questions via Slack, hoerver long you spend with that client chatting is billable.

**So what is not billable?**  
Most internal conversations will not be billable. For example, if another developer asks you to jump on a call to bounce off ideas on what he/she is working on, that would not be billable. Or if you ask for help on something you are not sure about and you would like to jump on a call with someone, that time on that call would not be billable.
