# Photon Software Rule Book

Every one who writes code for Photon Software must always, without exception, follow a simple set of rules:  
* **Comment all code -** Make it easier for future developers (including yourself) to jump right in and understand the logic  
* **DRY -** Don't Reapeat Yourself. Always read through your code to spot inefficiencies  
* **Every project has a repo -** Every line of code written must be under version control  
* **Every dev has a branch -** Developers must always work under their own branch within a repo  
* **Every task has a commit -** It is important to commit every change we complete

Following these simple set of rules ensures collaborative team work without conflicts and allows us to produce scalable and maintainable code.
