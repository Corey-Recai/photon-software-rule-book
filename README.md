# Photon Software Rule Book
---

Every one who writes code for Photon Software must always, without exception, follow a simple set of rules:  
* *Comment all code -* By making sure all your code is well commented you make it easier for future developers (including yourself) to jump right in and understand the logic.  
* DRY - Don't Reapeat Yourself. Always read through your code to spot inefficiencies  
* Every project has a repo  
* Every dev has a branch  
* Every task has a commit

Following these simple set of rules ensures collaborative team work without conflicts and allows us to produce scalable and maintainable code.  Keep in mind that the developer who works on the code later could be yourself.
