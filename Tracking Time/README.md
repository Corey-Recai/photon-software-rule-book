# Tracking Your Time

**How do we track hours?**  
We track hours using [Premise Time Tracker](https://premisetimetracker.com). The app has a chrome extension that makes it extremely easy to track your time per task.

When tracking your time, you must always:  
* Include a Client.  
* Include a Project.  
* Track as you go. Never wait until the end of the week to enter all your time.

Sometimes knowing what is billable can be a little hazy. Here are some notes that can answer common questions around tracking hours and what is billable work. 

**Is a phone call billable?**  
Absolutely. As a developer, every phone call you are on with the client is billable.  

**What about other forms of communication?**  
Yes. All project related communication is billable. However long it takes you to write an email to explain functionality, or discuss a project will be billable. If a client has questions via Slack, however long you spend with that client discussing the project is billable.

**So what is not billable?**  
Some internal communications will not be billable. The most common scenario is if you run into an issue and need help. If a senior developer jumps on a video call with you and you both spend an hour working through an issue, that time is not billable.
