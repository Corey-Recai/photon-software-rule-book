# Project Management

In this section we'll discuss all about tracking progress through the life of a project, the tools we use to manage a project, and the process we have in place to ensure that deadlines are met.

### Tracking Progress

There are 3 metrics that we rely on to track progress per project:  
* Time - Tracking hours accurately and daily.  
* Trello Cards - We use Trello to keep track of User Stories.  
* Sprints - Tracking the progress we make per Sprint gives us a realistic view on progress overall.

### Project Management Tools

**Trello**  
We use Trello to manage the User Stories on every project. User Stories describe the behavior and functionality that is expected out of the UI being developed. User Stories explain tasks from the client's (or user's) point of view-- They don't tell the developer how to write behavior, but rather how that behavior should work.

Trello also holds resources related to the project. Typically, this would be links to files like SOW, FTP access to client servers, import files, etc.

**Zeplin**  
Zeplin is a tool that we user to hand-off designs to the developer. Zeplin allows the developer to set styleguides, export assets, and produce a pixel perfect website. Zeplin, along with Trello, tell the developer the whole picture.

**Slack**  
Because our entire team is remote, communication (or overcommunication) is integral to our success. Slack is there for anyone to ask for help, update team members quickly, collaborate and help each other, answer questions, etc.

Always over communicate on your work/progress. Something that may seem insignificant could be a critical piece of information for another team memeber.

**Bitbucket**  
Bitbucket is the way our developers collaborate, review each others code, and submit and approve changes on a project. Without repositories our whole dev team would be flying blind.

**Google Docs**  
All assets, documentation, scope of work, or anything else related a project (except design files) is stored in Goolge Docs. Every team member working on a particular project will have access to the respective project directory in Google Docs.

### Status Calls

Every morning at 10AM CST we have a 15 minutes status call where everyone has a chance to voice any concerns and update the team on their progress. We keep these calls short and to the point.
