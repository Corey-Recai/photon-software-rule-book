# Business Hours

Our business hours are 9am to 5pm CST.

At Photon Software we believe that every team member should be trusted with the responsibility of managing their own schedule. We are all adults here and no one should be micro-managed.

Having said that, while we are not into micro-managing people, we do have a set of rules to manage expectations within the team. Here it is:  
* Whether you are physically working during 9-5 or not, we expect you to be available on Slack during this time. If a team member has a question about something you are working on, they should be able to get a hold of you within a reasonable time.  
* We encourage everyone to take breaks, 1 or 2 hours of lunch, and work at your own pace. As long as you are mindful of deadlines and over communicate with the team about your availability, no issues should arise and you should be able to have work-life balance.
* If you run into issues, speak up immediately. Do not wait until the next meeting or delay notiying the team under any circumstances.  
* Ask for help when you need it. You are responsible of making sure that you get the help you need. Team members will always be available to help, but you have to ask first.

As a Photon Software team member you are expected to be available on Slack during our business hours.
